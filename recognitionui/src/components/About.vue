        <h1 class="text-3xl">About</h1>
        <p>This is my pet project - an attempt to learn Vue and combine it with .NET backend.
            I have similar application written in Blazor so that I can compare performance. I don't have any prior
            experience with both
            of these as I've spent many years with WPF on the frontend.
